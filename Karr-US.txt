As a home gardener, I want to get in touch with people who want fresh produce, so I can make use of my surplus.

As a supporter of the local food movement, I want to find local produce, so I can reduce my carbon footprint.

As an early adopter, I want incentives to expand the network, so I can benefit from its growth.
